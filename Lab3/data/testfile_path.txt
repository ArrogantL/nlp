The

demonstrated
a
decreased

of
glucocorticoid

)
in
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
from
hypercholesterolemic
subjects
,
and
an
elevated
level
in

with
acute

In
the
lymphocytes

high
GR

dexamethasone
inhibited

incorporation
into

,
respectively
,
in
the

manner
as
in

.

On

other
hand
,
a
decreased
GR
number
resulted
in
a
less
efficient
dexamethasone

of
the
incorporation
of

.

These

showed
that
the

changed
only
with
a
decrease
of

At

)
could
serve
as
a
marker
of

,
the
authors
studied
specimens
of
breast
carcinomas
from
60
consecutive

.

Presence
of
beta

was
analyzed
by
immunohistochemistry
.

No
significant

were
found
between

such
as

However
,
there
was
a

,
is
shown
to
be
modulated
by
a

.

Mutation
of
a
kappa
B
core
sequence
identified
in
the

(
-206
to
-195
)
partially
inhibits
both
mitogen-
and
HTLV-I
Tax-mediated
activation
of
this
transcription
unit
and
blocks
the
specific

of
two

.

These
kappa
B-specific

(
80

kilodaltons
)
similarly
interact
with
the
functional
kappa
B
enhancer
present
in

These

that
these

to
address
this
question
.

Different
fragments

were
used
for

that
was
only
seen
with
nuclear

derived
from
B-cell
neoplasms
corresponding
to
the

to
be
dependent
on
the
actions
of
these

on
the
DNA
region
within

.

This
region
is
located
within
the
920
bp
fragment
located
210
bp
upstream
from
the

and
this
fragment
represents
a

[
Determination
of
the
sensitivity
to
glucocorticoids
in

]

A
modified
method
for
the
determination
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
human
lymphocytes
is
suggested
.

The
principal
distinction
of
the
method
is
standardization
by
the
lymphocyte
count
in
a
sample
(
1
mln
)
and
the
labeled
hormone
concentration
.

The
modification
saves
time
and
money
,
limits
the
range
of
the
data
variations
,
and
makes
use
of
a
lesser
volume
of
blood
.

Examinations
of
70
children
aged
4
to
15
suffering
from
the
nephrotic
form
of

have
made
it
possible
to
distinguish
two
groups
of
patients
:
with
relatively
high
values
of
specific
binding
X
=
6820.1
+/-
530.0
(
n
=
30
,
p
=
0.95
,
t
=
2.04
)
,
this
corresponding
to
a
clinical
form
of
hormone
-sensitive
glomerulonephritis
,
and
with
relatively
low
values
of
specific
binding
X
=
1815.2
+/-
302.8
(
n
=
40
,
p
=
0.95
,
t
=
1.96
)
,
that
corresponds
to
hormone
-resistant
glomerulonephritis
.

Dynamic
studies
have
not
shown
any
statistically
significant
changes
in
the
specific
binding
values
.

These
results
permit
regarding
the
specific
binding
value
as
a
prognostic
criterion
in
the
assessment
of
corticosteroid
therapy
;
this
allows
a
wide
employment
of

Octamer-binding
proteins
from
B
or
HeLa
cells
stimulate
transcription
of
the
immunoglobulin
heavy-chain
promoter
in
vitro
.

The
B-cell
-type
specificity
of
the
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
heavy-chain
and
light-chain
promoters
is
mediated
by
an
octanucleotide
(
OCTA
)
element
,
ATGCAAAT
,
that
is
also
a
functional
component
of
other
RNA
polymerase
II
promoters
,
such
as
snRNA
and
histone
H2B
promoters
.

Two
nuclear
proteins
that
bind
specifically
and
with
high
affinity
to
the
OCTA
element
have
been
identified
.

NF-A1
is
present
in
a
variety
of
cell
types
,
whereas
the
presence
of
NF-A2
is
essentially
confined
to
B
cells
,
leading
to
the
hypothesis
that
NF-A2
activates
cell-type-specific
transcription
of
the
Ig
promoter
and
NF-A1
mediates
the
other
responses
of
the
OCTA
element
.

Extracts
of
the
B-cell
line
,
BJA-B
,
contain
high
levels
of
NF-A2
and
specifically
transcribe
Ig
promoters
.

In
contrast
,
extracts
from
HeLa
cells
transcribed
the
Ig
promoter
poorly
.

Surprisingly
,
addition
of
either
affinity-enriched
NF-A2
or
NF-A1
to
either
a
HeLa
extract
or
a
partially
purified
reaction
system
specifically
stimulates
the
Ig
promoter
.

This
suggests
that
the
constitutive
OCTA-binding
factor
NF-A1
can
activate
transcription
of
the
Ig
promoter
and
that
B-cell
-specific
transcription
of
this
promoter
,
at
least
in
vitro
,
is
partially
due
to
a
quantitative
difference
in
the
amount
of
OCTA-binding
protein
.

Because
NF-A1
can
stimulate
Ig
transcription
,
the
inability
of
this
factor
to
activate
in
vivo
the
Ig
promoter
to
the
same
degree
as
the
snRNA
promoters
probably
reflects
a
difference
in
the
context
of
the
OCTA
element
in
these
two
types
of
promoters
.

Identification
of
a
putative
regulator
of
early
T
cell
activation
genes
.

Molecules
involved
in
the
antigen
receptor-dependent
regulation
of
early
T
cell
activation
genes
were
investigated
with
the
use
of
functional
sequences
of
the
T
cell
activation-specific
enhancer
of
interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
.

One
of
these
sequences
forms
a
protein
complex
,
NFAT-1
,
specifically
with
nuclear
extracts
of
activated
T
cells
.

This
complex
appeared
10
to
25
minutes
before
the
activation
of
the
IL-2
gene
.

Studies
with
inhibitors
of
protein
synthesis
indicated
that
the
time
of
synthesis
of
the
activator
of
the
IL-2
gene
in
Jurkat
T
cells
corresponds
to
the
time
of
appearance
of
NFAT-1
.

NFAT-1
,
or
a
very
similar
protein
,
bound
functional
sequences
of
the
long
terminal
repeat
(
LTR
)
of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
;
the
LTR
of
this
virus
is
known
to
be
stimulated
during
early
T
cell
activation
.

The
binding
site
for
this
complex
activated
a
linked
promoter
after
transfection
into
antigen
receptor-activated
T
cells
but
not
other
cell
types
.

These
characteristics
suggest
that
NFAT-1
transmits
signals
initiated
at
the
T
cell
antigen
receptor
.

Characterization
of
thyroid
hormone
receptors
in
human
IM-9
lymphocytes
.

Although
putatively
identified
more
than
10
years
ago
,
thyroid
hormone
receptors
in
human
tissues
remain
poorly
characterized
.

As
a
first
step
towards
understanding
the
mechanism
of
thyroid
hormone
action
in
man
we
have
characterized
T3
binding
sites
in
nuclei
of
the
human
lymphoblastoid
line
,
IM-9
cells
.

In
whole
cell
experiments
at
37
degrees
C
,
nuclear
binding
of
[
125I
]
T3
was
saturable
(
Kd
34
+/-
6
pmol/l
)
and
of
finite
capacity
(
approximately
equal
to
350
sites/cell
)
.

The
binding
sites
were
extracted
from
a
nuclear
pellet
by
treatment
with
0.4
mol/l
KCl
and
sonication
.

Separation
of
bound
from
free
[
125I
]
T3
in
the
extracts
was
achieved
using
the
calcium
phosphate
matrix
,
hydroxyapatite
at
a
concentration
of
0.3
ml
of
a
150
g/l
slurry
.

Rectilinear
Scatchard
plots
were
obtained
only
when
the
hydroxyapatite
was
washed
with
a
buffer
containing
0.5
%
Triton
X-100
.

Under
these
conditions
T3
binding
sites
in
the
nuclear
extracts
were
present
at
a
concentration
of
22.4
+/-
8.6
fmol/mg
protein
and
showed
an
affinity
of
(
Kd
,
room
temperature
)
140
+/-
10
pmol/l
.

The
same
assay
system
was
used
to
determine
the
hierarchy
of
affinities
for
a
range
of
natural
and
synthetic
analogues
.

Calling
T3
100
,
the
order
of
potencies
observed
was
:
Triac
,
500
;
3
,
5-diiodo-3'-isopropylthyronine
,
89
;
T4
,
32
;

,
5-dimethyl-3'isopropylthyronine

;

,
5-T2
,
0.7
,
rT3
,
0.4
;
3'5'-T2
,
less
than
0.01
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
T3
binding
sites
present
in
human
IM-9
lymphocyte
nuclei
and
extracts
thereof
are
thyroid
hormone
receptors
.

These
cells
may
be
a
useful
tool
to
increase
our
understanding
of
human
T3
receptors

Definition
of
T-cell
specific
DNA-binding
factors
that
interact
with
a
3'-silencer
in
the
CD4+
T-cell
gene
Rpt-1
.

Analysis
of
the
region
3
'
to
the
CD4+
T-cell
gene
Rpt-1
(
encoding
regulatory
protein
T-lymphocyte
1
)
led
to
the
definition
of
a
silencer
element
that
inhibits
heterologous
gene
expression
in
certain
CD4+
T-cell
lines
but
not
in
B-cell
or
non-lymphoid
cell
lines
.

Functional
silencer
activity
in
vivo
was
associated
with
the
presence
of
a
specific
silencer-DNA-protein
complex
in
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
with
T-cell
extracts
.

Formation
of
this
complex
was
selectively
inhibited
by
the
region
in
HIV-1
containing
a
silencer
element
.

We
discuss
the
possibility
that
DNA-binding
factors
may
coregulate
HIV-1
and
Rpt-1
gene
expression
through
a
common
transcriptional
silencer
element
.

Congenital
immunodeficiencies
associated
with
absence
of
HLA
class
II
antigens
on
lymphocytes
result
from
distinct
mutations
in
trans-acting
factors
.

Coordinate
regulation
of
HLA
class
II
gene
expression
during
development
and
coinduction
of
class
II
genes
by
soluble
factors
suggests
that
common
trans-acting
factor
(
s
)
control
expression
of
these
genes
.

In
B-lymphoblastoid
cell
lines
derived
from
two
independent
class
II-deficient
bare
lymphocyte
syndrome
patients
,
we
observed
a
drastic
decrease
in
transcription
rates
of
the
class
II
genes
.

When
these
cell
lines
are
fused
,
class
II
genes
are
reexpressed
,
indicating
that
immunodeficiencies
in
bare
lymphocyte
syndrome
patients
are
the
result
of
two
distinct
mutations
.

Further
studies
show
that
genes
governing
the
expression
of
class
II
antigens
fall
into
at
least
three
complementation
groups
;
two
of
these
were
previously
unidentified
in
mutant
cell
lines
generated
in

.

In
addition
,
we
report
the
identification
of
two
discrete
complexes
,
NFX1.1
and
NFX1.2
,
that
bind
to
the
DRA
X
consensus
element
.

Though
the
mutation
in
at

one
mutant
line
generated
in

(
RJ2.2.5
)
affects
products
functioning
via
interaction
with
the
X
box
,
clear
alterations
in
either
NFX1.1
or
NFX1.2
are
not

in
any
of
the

and

after

.

In
addition
,
there
was
a
significant
correlation
between
the
maximum
increase
in
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
and
the
maximum
decrease
in
lymphocytes
(
r
=
0.7514
,
p
less
than
0.0003
)
.

Simultaneous
measurements
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
by
whole-cell
assay
revealed
that
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
in
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
linearly
correlated
with
that
in
the
corresponding
lymphocytes
(
r
=
0.9482
,
p
less
than
0.0001
)
.

There
were
also
significant
correlations
between
the
maximum
increase
in
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
and
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
in
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
(
r
=
0.7239
,
p
less

0.0007
)
,
and
between
the
maximum
decrease
in

and
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
in
lymphocytes
(
r
=
0.7703
,
p
less
than
0.0002
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
individual
differences
are
preserved
both
in
glucocorticoid
responsiveness
and
in
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
in
peripheral
blood
leukocytes
in
normal
humans
.

Estradiol
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
in
hepatitis
B
virus
carriers
treated
with
interferon-alpha
.

Estradiol
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
and
the
effects
of
interferon-alpha
(
IFN-alpha
)
on
estradiol
receptors
were
studied
in
asymptomatic
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
carriers
,
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
and
normal
controls
.

The
level
of
estradiol
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
mononuclear
cells
was
significantly
lower
in
asymptomatic
HBV
carriers
and
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
,
compared
to
normal
controls
.

This
low
level
of
cytosol
estradiol
receptors
in
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
was
increased
by
the
administration
of
IFN-alpha
.

In
addition
,
when
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
from
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
were
incubated
with
IFN-alpha
in
vitro
,
the
level
of
cytosol
estradiol
receptors
also
increased
by
increasing
the
concentration
of
IFN-alpha
.

We
previously
reported
that
the
response
of
mononuclear
cells
to
estrogen
is
impaired
in
HBV
carriers
,
and
our
present
results
suggested
that
this
may
be
due
to
the
low
level
of
estradiol
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
mononuclear
cells
.

Association
of
increased
lytic
effector
cell
function
with
high
estrogen
receptor
levels
in
tumor-bearing
patients
with
breast
cancer
.

Tumor-bearing
patients
with
breast
cancer
were
assayed
for
their
natural
killer
(
NK
)
cell
activity
and
for
the
function
of
activated
cytotoxic
T-cells
,
as
assessed
by
lectin-dependent
cellular
cytotoxicity
(
LDCC
)
.

Tumor-bearing
patients
with
breast
cancer
had
a
significant
increase
in
NK
activity
and
in
LDCC
,
as
compared
with
healthy
control
individuals
.

Although
the
enhanced
NK
cell
activity
and
LDCC
were
closely
associated
with
high
levels
(
greater
than
31
fmol/mg
)
of
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
content
in
the
primary
tumor
,
no
other
clinical
or
histologic
correlation
between
the
increase
in
either
parameter
of
cytotoxic
effector
cell
function
could
be
found
.

Thus
,
ER
levels
greater
than
31
fmol/mg
might
be
associated
with
increased
cytotoxic
effector
cell
function
in
tumor-bearing
patients
with
breast
cancer
.

Properties
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed
lymphocytes
from
patients
with
familial
cortisol
resistance
.

In
a
previous
report
of
two
patients
with
familial
glucocorticoid
resistance
due
to
reduced
numbers
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
(
GR
)
,
we
have
shown
decreased
numbers
of
GR
in
peripheral
mononuclear
cells
and
cultured
fibroblasts
but
normal
affinity
of
GR
in
both
patients
.

In
this
study
,
peripheral
lymphocytes
from
these
patients
,
one
patient
's
son
and
daughter
,
and
normal
subjects
were
transformed
with
Epstein-Barr
virus
.

Reduced
numbers
and
normal
affinity
of
GR
were
found
in
the
Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed
lymphocytes
from
both
patients
while
the
son
and
daughter
had
normal
numbers
and
affinity
of
GR
.

The
thermal
stability
of
GR
and
thermal
activation
of
cytosolic
receptors
in
both
patients
were
found
to
be
normal
.

Although
the
percentages
of
nuclear
bound
GR
were
similar
in
both
patients
and
normal
controls
,
the
absolute
amounts
of
nuclear
bound
GR
of
the
patients
were
about
one-half
that
of
normal
controls
.

These
abnormal
properties
of
GR
(
reduced
numbers
of
GR
)
were
preserved
in
the
transformed
cells
from
the
patients
.

Octamer
transcription
factors
1
and
2
each
bind
to
two
different
functional
elements
in
the
immunoglobulin
heavy-chain
promoter
.

Immunoglobulin
heavy-chain
genes
contain
two
conserved
sequence
elements
5
'
to
the
site
of
transcription
initiation
:
the
octamer
ATGCAAAT
and
the
heptamer
CTCATGA
.

Both
of
these
elements
are
required
for
normal
cell-specific
promoter
function
.

The
present
study
demonstrates
that
both
the
ubiquitous
and
lymphoid-cell-specific
octamer
transcription
factors
(
OTF-1
and
OTF-2
,
respectively
)
interact
specifically
with
each
of
the
two
conserved
sequence
elements
,
forming
either
homo-
or
heterodimeric
complexes
.

This
was
surprising
,
since
the
heptamer
and
octamer
sequence
motifs
bear
no
obvious
similarity
to
each
other
.

Binding
of
either
factor
to
the
octamer
element
occurred
independently
.

However
,
OTF
interaction
with
the
heptamer
sequence
appeared
to
require
the
presence
of
an
intact
octamer
motif
and
occurred
with
a
spacing
of
either
2
or
14
base
pairs
between
the
two
elements
,
suggesting
coordinate
binding
resulting
from
protein-protein
interactions
.

The
degeneracy
in
sequences
recognized
by
the
OTFs
may
be
important
in
widening
the
range
over
which
gene
expression
can
be
modulated
and
in
establishing
cell
type
specificity
.

Identification
of
a
novel
lymphoid
specific
octamer
binding
protein
(
OTF-2B
)
by
proteolytic
clipping
bandshift
assay
(
PCBA
)
.

The
octamer
sequence
ATGCAAAT
is
found
in
the
promoters
of
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
heavy
and
light
chain
genes
and
in
the
heavy
chain
enhancer
and
is
a
major
determinant
of
the
cell
type
specific
expression
of
Ig
genes
in
B
cells
.

An
apparent
paradox
is
that
the
same
sequence
serves
as
an
upstream
promoter
or
enhancer
element
in
a
variety
of
housekeeping
genes
such
as
the
histone
H2B
and
U
snRNA
genes
.

The
differential
usage
of
this
regulatory
sequence
motif
is
thought
to
be
mediated
by
different
species
of
octamer
binding
proteins
.

One
species
of
100
kd
,
designated
OTF-1
,
is
present
in
all
cell
types
and
may
exert
its
activating
function
only
when
it
can
interact
with
additional
adjacent
transcription
factors
.

The
lymphoid
cell
specific
octamer
binding
protein
of
60
kd
(
OTF-2A
)
specifically
stimulates
Ig
promoters
which
consist
essentially
of
a
TATA-box
and
an
octamer
sequence
upstream
of
it
.

Here
we
present
evidence
for
yet
another
B
cell
specific
octamer
binding
protein
of
75
kd
(
OTF-2B
)
.

From
several
findings
,
including
the
absence
of
OTF-2B
(
but
not
OTF-2A
)
from
a
lymphocyte
line
that
can
not
respond
to
the
IgH
enhancer
,
we
propose
a
role
of
the
novel
octamer
factor
in
the
long
range
activation
by
the
IgH
enhancer
.

We
have
used
the
proteolytic
clipping
bandshift
assay
(
PCBA
)
technique
to
distinguish
the
three
different
forms
found
in
B
cells
.

This
analysis
indicates
that
the
75
kd-species
OTF-2B
is
closely
related
to
the
60
kd
species
OTF-2A
.

Inhibition
of
interleukin
2
-induced
proliferation
of
cloned
murine
T
cells
by
glucocorticoids
.

Possible
involvement
of
an
inhibitory
protein
.

The
ability
of
glucocorticoids
to
inhibit
interleukin
2
(
IL
2
)
-induced
T
cell
proliferation
in
two
cytotoxic
T
cell
(
CTL
)
clones
has
been
studied
.

A
complete
inhibition
of
DNA
synthesis
by
dexamethasone
(
Dx
)
could
be
observed
when
IL
2-depleted
cultures
of
CTL
were
either
incubated
for
6
h
with
the
hormone
prior
to
the
addition
of
IL
2
or
treated
simultaneously
with
Dx
and
a
low
concentration
of
IL
2
.

No
significant
reduction
in
the
number
and
affinity
of
IL
2
receptors
was
seen
after
6
h
incubation
with
Dx
.

The
order
of
potency
observed
with
the
different
steroids
indicated
that
this
inhibitory
effect
was
mediated
through
binding
to
a
specific
glucocorticoid
receptor
.

The
action
of
these
hormones
possibly
involves
the
synthesis
of
an
inhibitory
protein
(
s
)
,
since
the
presence
of
cycloheximide
during
the
incubation
with
Dx
prevented
the
inhibition
of
DNA
synthesis
.

Furthermore
,
supernatant
from
Dx-treated
CTL
contained
a
nondialyzable
factor
which
inhibited
DNA
synthesis
and
cell
growth
of
CTL
clones
induced
by
IL
2
.

Blocking
of
IL
2
synthesis
and
IL
2
receptor
formation
have
been
proposed
as
one
of
the
major
mechanisms
of
glucocorticoid-induced
immunosuppression
.

Our
results
indicate
that
these
hormones
may
also
affect
T
cell
proliferation
by
inhibiting
IL
2
activity
.

Identification
and
purification
of
a
human
immunoglobulin-enhancer-binding
protein
(
NF-kappa
B
)
that
activates
transcription
from
a
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
promoter
in
vitro
.

The
enhancer-binding
factor
NF-kappa
B
,
which
is
found
only
in
cells
that
transcribe
immunoglobulin
light
chain
genes
,
has
been
purified
from
nuclear
extracts
of
Namalwa
cells
(
human
Burkitt
lymphoma
cells
)
by
sequence-specific
DNA
affinity
chromatography
.

The
purified
NF-kappa
B
has
been
identified
as
a
51-kDa
polypeptide
by
UV-crosslinking
analysis
.

``
Footprint
''
and
methylation-interference
analyses
have
shown
that
purified
NF-kappa
B
has
a
binding
activity
specific
for
the
kappa
light
chain
enhancer
sequence
.

The
purified
factor
activated
in

transcription
of
the

type
I

by
binding
to
an

Lymphocyte
glucocorticoid
receptor
binding
in
depression
:
normal
values
following
recovery
.

The
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
in
lymphocytes
and
plasma
cortisol
concentrations
were
measured
in
20
patients
who
had
recovered
from
major
depressive
disorder
and
20
healthy
control
subjects
.

The
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
in
lymphocytes
from
the
recovered
depressed
group
was
not
significantly
different
from
that
of
the
control
group
.

Although
the
mean
plasma
cortisol
concentration
in
recovered
depressives
was
higher
than
in
control
subjects
,
the
difference
only
just
reached
significance
.

This
study
shows
that
the
reduction
in
glucocorticoid
receptor
numbers
which
occurs
during
acute
depressive
illness
does
not
persist
on
recovery
and
is
,
therefore
,
state-dependent
.

Identification
and
purification
of
a
human
lymphoid-specific
octamer-binding
protein
(
OTF-2
)
that
activates
transcription
of
an
immunoglobulin
promoter
in
vitro
.

The
octamer
sequence
5'-ATGCAAAT
,
in
either
orientation
,
serves
as
an
upstream
element
in
a
variety
of
promoters
and
also
occurs
as
a
modular
enhancer
element
.

It
is
of
particular
interest
in
immunoglobulin
genes
since
it
is
found
in
the
upstream
regions
of
all
heavy
and
light
chain
promoters
and
in
the
heavy
chain
enhancer
,
both
of
which
are
known
to
be
necessary
for
cell-specific
expression
.

We
report
here
the
chromatographic
separation
of
ubiquitous
and
B
cell-specific
octamer-binding
proteins
.

The
B
cell
factor
was
purified
to
homogeneity
using
affinity
chromatography
and
consists
of
three
peptides
of
62
,
61
,
and
58.5
+/-
1.5
kd
.

Each
of
the
polypeptides
was
renatured
after
SDS-PAGE
and
shown
to
bind
to
the
octamer
sequence
.

The
specific
DNA
binding
activity
of
the
pure
B
cell-specific
factor
was
indistinguishable
from
that
of
the
affinity-purified
ubiquitous
factor
.

This
B
cell-specific
octamer-binding
factor
,
in
pure
form
,
activated
transcription
from
a
kappa
light
chain
promoter
in
vitro
,
thus
demonstrating
that
it
is
indeed
a
B
cell-specific
transcription
factor
for
this
gene
.

In
addition
to
the
ubiquitous
and
B
cell-specific
octamer-binding
factors
,
we
identified
several
additional
proteins
,
one
of
which
is
B
cell
-specific
,
that
interact
with
the
kappa
promoter
.

Decreased
deoxyribonucleic
acid
binding
of
glucocorticoid-receptor
complex
in
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
a
patient
with
the
glucocorticoid
resistance
syndrome
.

A
patient
with
the
syndrome
of
glucocorticoid
resistance
was
studied
.

A
27-yr-old
woman
initially
was
diagnosed
as
having
Cushing
's
disease
,
based
on
the
findings
of
high
plasma
ACTH
and
serum
cortisol
levels
,
increased
urinary
cortisol
secretion
,
resistance
to
adrenal
suppression
with
dexamethasone
,
and
bilateral
adrenal
hyperplasia
by
computed
tomography
and
scintigraphy
of
the
adrenal
glands
.

However
,
she
had
no
signs
or
symptoms
of
Cushing
's
syndrome
.

During
a
5-yr
follow-up
,
no
clinical
abnormalities
developed
,
although
hypercortisolism
persisted
.

End-organ
resistance
to
cortisol
was
suspected
.

To
explain
the
end-organ
resistance
to
cortisol
,
the
glucocorticoid
receptors
(
GR
)
in
peripheral
mononuclear
leukocytes
and
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
a
forearm
skin
biopsy
were
characterized
and
compared
with
the
results
of
similar
studies
in
normal
subjects
.

The
patient
's
GR
in
whole
cell
assays
had
an
increased
dissociation
constant
(
Kd
)
.

In
the
cytosol
of
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
the
patient
,
there
was
also
decreased
binding
capacity
.

The
thermal
stability
and
the
sedimentation
coefficient
in
a
sucrose
density
gradient
of
the
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
the
patient
and
normal
subjects
were
similar
.

GR
complex
activation
,
analyzed
by
DEAE-cellulose
chromatography
,
was
decreased
in
the
patient
.

DNA
binding
of
the
GR
complex
after
temperature-induced
activation
was
lower
in
the
patient
than
in
normal
subjects
.

Nuclear
translocation
of
GR
complexes
from
the
patient
was
also
slightly
decreased
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
patient
's
glucocorticoid
resistance
was
due
to
a
decrease
in
the
affinity
of
the
receptor
for
glucocorticoids
and
a
decrease
in
the
binding
of
the
GR
complex
to
DNA
.

Sensitive
and
receptor-mediated

by
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3
in
normal
human
peripheral

lymphocytes
.

We
show
that
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3
(
1
,
25
[
OH
]
2D3
)
,
the
most
hormonally
active
metabolite
of
vitamin
D3
,
modulates
sensitively
and
specifically
both
the
protein
and
messenger
RNA
accumulation
of
the
multilineage
growth
factor
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating

(
GM-CSF
)
.

The
regulation
of
GM-CSF
expression
is
seen
in
both
normal
human
mitogen-activated

and

from
a
line
(
S-LB1
)
transformed
with
human

.

In
