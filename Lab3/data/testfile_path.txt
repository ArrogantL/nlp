(
3beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
I
and
II
)
in
B-LCL
and
T
cells
.

Transcripts
for
CYP19
and
HSD11K
were
not
detected
.

Corresponding
enzymatic
activity
was
detectable
only
for
17-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
and
5alpha-reductase
,
respectively
producing
testosterone
and
5alpha-dihydrotestosterone
.

Steroid
identities
were
confirmed
by
gas
chromatography/mass
spectrometry
(
GC/MS
)
.

One
metabolite
thought
to
be
deoxycorticosterone
was
identified
by
GC/MS
as
6alpha-hydroxypregnanolone
.

It
was
concluded
that
sex
hormone
metabolism
,
including
androgen
synthesis
,
occurs
in
lymphocytes
,
and
may
modulate
immune
response
.

Human
white
blood
cells
and
hair
follicles
are
good
sources
of
mRNA
for
the
pterin
carbinolamine
dehydratase/dimerization
cofactor
of
HNF1
for
mutation
detection
.

Pterin
carbinolamine
dehydratase/dimerization
cofactor
of
HNF1
(
PCD/DCoH
)
is
a
protein
that
has
a
dual
function
.

It
is
a
pterin
4alpha-carbinolamine
dehydratase
that
is
involved
in
the
regeneration
of
the
cofactor
tetrahydrobiopterin
during
the
phenylalanine
hydroxylase-
catalyzed
hydroxylation
of
phenylalanine
.

In
addition
,
it
is
the
dimerization
cofactor
of
HNF1
that
is
able
to
activate
the
transcriptional
activity
of
HNF1
.

Deficiencies
in
the
gene
for
this
dual
functional
protein
result
in
hyperphenylalaninemia
.

Here
we
report
for
the
first
time
that
the
PCD/DCoH
mRNA
is
present
in
human
white
blood
cells
and
hair
follicles
.

Taking
advantage
of
this
finding
,
a
sensitive
,
rapid
and
convenient
method
for
screening
mutations
occurring
in
the
coding
region
of
this
gene
has
been
described
.

Biochemical
characterization
of
the
NF-Y
transcription
factor
complex
during
B
lymphocyte
development

The
transcription
factor
,
NF-Y
,
plays
a
critical
role
in
tissue-specific
major
histocompatibility
complex
class
II
gene
transcription
.

In
this
report
the
biochemical
properties
of
the
heterotrimeric
NF-Y
complex
have
been
characterized
during
stage-specific
B-cell
development
,
and
in
several
class
II-
mutant
B-cell
lines
,
which
represent
distinct
bare
