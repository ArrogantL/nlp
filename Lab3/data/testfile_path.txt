The

demonstrated
a
decreased

of
glucocorticoid

)
in
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
from
hypercholesterolemic
subjects
,
and
an
elevated
level
in

with
acute

In
the
lymphocytes

high
GR

dexamethasone
inhibited

incorporation
into

,
respectively
,
in
the

manner
as
in

.

On

other
hand
,
a
decreased
GR
number
resulted
in
a
less
efficient
dexamethasone

of
the
incorporation
of

.

These

showed
that
the

changed
only
with
a
decrease
of

At

)
could
serve
as
a
marker
of

,
the
authors
studied
specimens
of
breast
carcinomas
from
60
consecutive

.

Presence
of
beta

was
analyzed
by
immunohistochemistry
.

No
significant

were
found
between

such
as

However
,
there
was
a

,
is
shown
to
be
modulated
by
a

.

Mutation
of
a
kappa
B
core
sequence
identified
in
the

(
-206
to
-195
)
partially
inhibits
both
mitogen-
and
HTLV-I
Tax-mediated
activation
of
this
transcription
unit
and
blocks
the
specific

of
two

.

These
kappa
B-specific

(
80

kilodaltons
)
similarly
interact
with
the
functional
kappa
B
enhancer
present
in

These

that
these

to
address
this
question
.

Different
fragments

were
used
for

that
was
only
seen
with
nuclear

derived
from
B-cell
neoplasms
corresponding
to
the

to
be
dependent
on
the
actions
of
these

on
the
DNA
region
within

.

This
region
is
located
within
the
920
bp
fragment
located
210
bp
upstream
from
the

and
this
fragment
represents
a

[
Determination
of
the
sensitivity
to
glucocorticoids
in

]

A
modified
method
for
the
determination
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
human
lymphocytes
is
suggested
.

The
principal
distinction
of
the
method
is
standardization
by
the
lymphocyte
count
in
a
sample
(
1
mln
)
and
the
labeled
hormone
concentration
.

The
modification
saves
time
and
money
,
limits
the
range
of
the
data
variations
,
and
makes
use
of
a
lesser
volume
of
blood
.

Examinations
of
70
children
aged
4
to
15
suffering
from
the
nephrotic
form
of

have
made
it
possible
to
distinguish
two
groups
of
patients
:
with
relatively
high
values
of
specific
binding
X
=
6820.1
+/-
530.0
(
n
=
30
,
p
=
0.95
,
t
=
2.04
)
,
this
corresponding
to
a
clinical
form
of
hormone
-sensitive
glomerulonephritis
,
and
with
relatively
low
values
of
specific
binding
X
=
1815.2
+/-
302.8
(
n
=
40
,
p
=
0.95
,
t
=
1.96
)
,
that
corresponds
to
hormone
-resistant
glomerulonephritis
.

Dynamic
studies
have
not
shown
any
statistically
significant
changes
in
the
specific
binding
values
.

These
results
permit
regarding
the
specific
binding
value
as
a
prognostic
criterion
in
the
assessment
of
corticosteroid
therapy
;
this
allows
a
wide
employment
of

Octamer-binding
proteins
from
B
or
HeLa
cells
stimulate
transcription
of
the
immunoglobulin
heavy-chain
promoter
in
vitro
.

The
B-cell
-type
specificity
of
the
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
heavy-chain
and
light-chain
promoters
is
mediated
by
an
octanucleotide
(
OCTA
)
element
,
ATGCAAAT
,
that
is
also
a
functional
component
of
other
RNA
polymerase
II
promoters
,
such
as
snRNA
and
histone
H2B
promoters
.

Two
nuclear
proteins
that
bind
specifically
and
with
high
affinity
to
the
OCTA
element
have
been
identified
.

NF-A1
is
present
in
a
variety
of
cell
types
,
whereas
the
presence
of
NF-A2
is
essentially
confined
to
B
cells
,
leading
to
the
hypothesis
that
NF-A2
activates
cell-type-specific
transcription
of
the
Ig
promoter
and
NF-A1
mediates
the
other
responses
of
the
OCTA
element
.

Extracts
of
the
B-cell
line
,
BJA-B
,
contain
high
levels
of
NF-A2
and
specifically
transcribe
Ig
promoters
.

In
contrast
,
extracts
from
HeLa
cells
transcribed
the
Ig
promoter
poorly
.

Surprisingly
,
addition
of
either
affinity-enriched
NF-A2
or
NF-A1
to
either
a
HeLa
extract
or
a
partially
purified
reaction
system
specifically
stimulates
the
Ig
promoter
.

This
suggests
that
the
constitutive
OCTA-binding
factor
NF-A1
can
activate
transcription
of
the
Ig
promoter
and
that
B-cell
-specific
transcription
of
this
promoter
,
at
least
in
vitro
,
is
partially
due
to
a
quantitative
difference
in
the
amount
of
OCTA-binding
protein
.

Because
NF-A1
can
stimulate
Ig
transcription
,
the
inability
of
this
factor
to
activate
in
vivo
the
Ig
promoter
to
the
same
degree
as
the
snRNA
promoters
probably
reflects
a
difference
in
the
context
of
the
OCTA
element
in
these
two
types
of
promoters
.

Identification
of
a
putative
regulator
of
early
T
cell
activation
genes
.

Molecules
involved
in
the
antigen
receptor-dependent
regulation
of
early
T
cell
activation
genes
were
investigated
with
the
use
of
functional
sequences
of
the
T
cell
activation-specific
enhancer
of
interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
.

One
of
these
sequences
forms
a
protein
complex
,
NFAT-1
,
specifically
with
nuclear
extracts
of
activated
T
cells
.

This
complex
appeared
10
to
25
minutes
before
the
activation
of
the
IL-2
gene
.

Studies
with
inhibitors
of
protein
synthesis
indicated
that
the
time
of
synthesis
of
the
activator
of
the
IL-2
gene
in
Jurkat
T
cells
corresponds
to
the
time
of
appearance
of
NFAT-1
.

NFAT-1
,
or
a
very
similar
protein
,
bound
functional
sequences
of
the
long
terminal
repeat
(
LTR
)
of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
;
the
LTR
of
this
virus
is
known
to
be
stimulated
during
early
T
cell
activation
.

The
binding
site
for
this
complex
activated
a
linked
promoter
after
transfection
into
antigen
receptor-activated
T
cells
but
not
other
cell
types
.

These
characteristics
suggest
that
NFAT-1
transmits
signals
initiated
at
the
T
cell
antigen
receptor
.

Characterization
of
thyroid
hormone
receptors
in
human
IM-9
lymphocytes
.

Although
putatively
identified
more
than
10
years
ago
,
thyroid
hormone
receptors
in
human
tissues
remain
poorly
characterized
.

As
a
first
step
towards
understanding
the
mechanism
of
thyroid
hormone
action
in
man
we
have
characterized
T3
binding
sites
in
nuclei
of
the
human
lymphoblastoid
line
,
IM-9
cells
.

In
whole
cell
experiments
at
37
degrees
C
,
nuclear
binding
of
[
125I
]
T3
was
saturable
(
Kd
34
+/-
6
pmol/l
)
and
of
finite
capacity
(
approximately
equal
to
350
sites/cell
)
.

The
binding
sites
were
extracted
from
a
nuclear
pellet
by
treatment
with
0.4
mol/l
KCl
and
sonication
.

Separation
of
bound
from
free
[
125I
]
T3
in
the
extracts
was
achieved
using
the
calcium
phosphate
matrix
,
hydroxyapatite
at
a
concentration
of
0.3
ml
of
a
150
g/l
slurry
.

Rectilinear
Scatchard
plots
were
obtained
only
when
the
hydroxyapatite
was
washed
with
a
buffer
containing
0.5
%
Triton
X-100
.

Under
these
conditions
T3
binding
sites
in
the
nuclear
extracts
were
present
at
a
concentration
of
22.4
+/-
8.6
fmol/mg
protein
and
showed
an
affinity
of
(
Kd
,
room
temperature
)
140
+/-
10
pmol/l
.

The
same
assay
system
was
used
to
determine
the
hierarchy
of
affinities
for
a
range
of
natural
and
synthetic
analogues
.

Calling
T3
100
,
the
order
of
potencies
observed
was
:
Triac
,
500
;
3
,
5-diiodo-3'-isopropylthyronine
,
89
;
T4
,
32
;

,
5-dimethyl-3'isopropylthyronine

;

,
5-T2
,
0.7
,
rT3
,
0.4
;
3'5'-T2
,
less
than
0.01
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
T3
binding
sites
present
in
human
IM-9
lymphocyte
nuclei
and
extracts
thereof
are
thyroid
hormone
receptors
.

These
cells
may
be
a
useful
tool
to
increase
our
understanding
of
human
T3
receptors

Definition
of
T-cell
specific
DNA-binding
factors
that
interact
with
a
3'-silencer
in
the
CD4+
T-cell
gene
Rpt-1
.

Analysis
of
the
region
3
'
to
the
CD4+
T-cell
gene
Rpt-1
(
encoding
regulatory
protein
T-lymphocyte
1
)
led
to
the
definition
of
a
silencer
element
that
inhibits
heterologous
gene
expression
in
certain
CD4+
T-cell
lines
but
not
in
B-cell
or
non-lymphoid
cell
lines
.

Functional
silencer
activity
in
vivo
was
associated
with
the
presence
of
a
specific
silencer-DNA-protein
complex
in
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
with
T-cell
extracts
.

Formation
of
this
complex
was
selectively
inhibited
by
the
region
in
HIV-1
containing
a
silencer
element
.

We
discuss
the
possibility
that
DNA-binding
factors
may
coregulate
HIV-1
and
Rpt-1
gene
expression
through
a
common
transcriptional
silencer
element
.

Congenital
immunodeficiencies
associated
with
absence
of
HLA
class
II
antigens
on
lymphocytes
result
from
distinct
mutations
in
trans-acting
factors
.

Coordinate
regulation
of
HLA
class
II
gene
expression
during
development
and
coinduction
of
class
II
genes
by
soluble
factors
suggests
that
common
trans-acting
factor
(
s
)
control
expression
of
these
genes
.

In
B-lymphoblastoid
cell
lines
derived
from
two
independent
class
II-deficient
bare
lymphocyte
syndrome
patients
,
we
observed
a
drastic
decrease
in
transcription
rates
of
the
class
II
genes
.

When
these
cell
lines
are
fused
,
class
II
genes
are
reexpressed
,
indicating
that
immunodeficiencies
in
bare
lymphocyte
syndrome
patients
are
the
result
of
two
distinct
mutations
.

Further
studies
show
that
genes
governing
the
expression
of
class
II
antigens
fall
into
at
least
three
complementation
groups
;
two
of
these
were
previously
unidentified
in
mutant
cell
lines
generated
in

.

In
addition
,
we
report
the
identification
of
two
discrete
complexes
,
NFX1.1
and
NFX1.2
,
that
bind
to
the
DRA
X
consensus
element
.

Though
the
mutation
in
at

one
mutant
line
generated
in

(
RJ2.2.5
)
affects
products
functioning
via
interaction
with
the
X
box
,
clear
alterations
in
either
NFX1.1
or
NFX1.2
are
not

in
any
of
the

after

.

In
addition
,
there
was
a
significant
correlation
between
the
maximum
increase
in
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
and
the
maximum
decrease
in
lymphocytes
(
r
=
0.7514
,
p
less
than
0.0003
)
.

Simultaneous
measurements
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
by
whole-cell
assay
revealed
that
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
in
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
linearly
correlated
with
that
in
the
corresponding
lymphocytes
(
r
=
0.9482
,
p
less
than
0.0001
)
.

There
were
also
significant
correlations
between
the
maximum
increase
in
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
and
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
in
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
(
r
=
0.7239
,
p
less

0.0007
)
,
and
between
the
maximum
decrease
in

and
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
in
lymphocytes
(
r
=
0.7703
,
p
less
than
0.0002
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
individual
differences
are
preserved
both
in
glucocorticoid
responsiveness
and
in
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
in
peripheral
blood
leukocytes
in
normal
humans
.

Estradiol
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
in
hepatitis
B
virus
carriers
treated
with
interferon-alpha
.

Estradiol
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
and
the
effects
of
interferon-alpha
(
IFN-alpha
)
on
estradiol
receptors
were
studied
in
asymptomatic
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
carriers
,
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
and
normal
controls
.

The
level
of
estradiol
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
mononuclear
cells
was
significantly
lower
in
asymptomatic
HBV
carriers
and
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
,
compared
to
normal
controls
.

This
low
level
of
cytosol
estradiol
receptors
in
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
was
increased
by
the
administration
of
IFN-alpha
.

In
addition
,
when
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
from
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
were
incubated
with
IFN-alpha
in
vitro
,
the
level
of
cytosol
estradiol
receptors
also
increased
by
increasing
the
concentration
of
IFN-alpha
.

We
previously
reported
that
the
response
of
mononuclear
cells
to
estrogen
is
impaired
in
HBV
carriers
,
and
our
present
results
suggested
that
this
may
be
due
to
the
low
level
of
estradiol
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
mononuclear
cells
.

Association
of
increased
lytic
effector
cell
function
with
high
estrogen
receptor
levels
in
tumor-bearing
patients
with
breast
cancer
.

Tumor-bearing
patients
with
breast
cancer
were
assayed
for
their
natural
killer
(
NK
)
cell
activity
and
for
the
function
of
activated
cytotoxic
T-cells
,
as
assessed
by
lectin-dependent
cellular
cytotoxicity
(
LDCC
)
.

Tumor-bearing
patients
with
breast
cancer
had
a
significant
increase
in
NK
activity
and
in
LDCC
,
as
compared
with
healthy
control
individuals
.

Although
the
enhanced
NK
cell
activity
and
LDCC
were
closely
associated
with
high
levels
(
greater
than
31
fmol/mg
)
of
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
content
in
the
primary
tumor
,
no
other
clinical
or
histologic
correlation
between
the
increase
in
either
parameter
of
cytotoxic
effector
cell
function
could
be
found
.

Thus
,
ER
levels
greater
than
31
fmol/mg
might
be
associated
with
increased
cytotoxic
effector
cell
function
in
tumor-bearing
patients
with
breast
cancer
.

Properties
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed
lymphocytes
from
patients
with
familial
cortisol
resistance
.

In
a
previous
report
of
two
patients
with
familial
glucocorticoid
resistance
due
to
reduced
numbers
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
(
GR
)
,
we
have
shown
decreased
numbers
of
GR
in
peripheral
mononuclear
cells
and
cultured
fibroblasts
but
normal
affinity
of
GR
in
both
patients
.

In
this
study
,
peripheral
lymphocytes
from
these
patients
,
one
patient
's
son
and
daughter
,
and
normal
subjects
were
transformed
with
Epstein-Barr
virus
.

Reduced
numbers
and
normal
affinity
of
GR
were
found
in
the
Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed
lymphocytes
from
both
patients
while
the
son
and
daughter
had
normal
numbers
and
affinity
of
GR
.

The
thermal
stability
of
GR
and
thermal
activation
of
cytosolic
receptors
in
both
patients
were
found
to
be
normal
.

Although
the
percentages
of
nuclear
bound
GR
were
similar
in
both
patients
and
normal
controls
,
the
absolute
amounts
of
nuclear
bound
GR
of
the
patients
were
about
one-half
that
of
normal
controls
.

These
abnormal
properties
of
GR
(
reduced
numbers
of
GR
)
were
preserved
in
the
transformed
cells
from
the
patients
.

Octamer
transcription
factors
1
and
2
each
bind
to
two
different
functional
elements
in
the
immunoglobulin
heavy-chain
promoter
.

Immunoglobulin
heavy-chain
genes
contain
two
conserved
sequence
elements
5
'
to
the
site
of
transcription
initiation
:
the
octamer
ATGCAAAT
and
the
heptamer
CTCATGA
.

Both
of
these
elements
are
required
for
normal
cell-specific
promoter
function
.

The
present
study
demonstrates
that
both
the
ubiquitous
and
lymphoid-cell-specific
octamer
transcription
factors
(
OTF-1
and
OTF-2
,
respectively
)
interact
specifically
with
each
of
the
two
conserved
sequence
elements
,
forming
either
homo-
or
heterodimeric
complexes
.

This
was
surprising
,
since
the
heptamer
and
octamer
sequence
motifs
bear
no
obvious
similarity
to
each
other
.

Binding
of
either
factor
to
the
octamer
element
occurred
independently
.

However
,
OTF
interaction
with
the
heptamer
sequence
appeared
to
require
the
presence
of
an
intact
octamer
motif
and
occurred
with
a
spacing
of
either
2
or
14
base
pairs
between
the
two
elements
,
suggesting
coordinate
binding
resulting
from
protein-protein
interactions
.

The
degeneracy
in
sequences
recognized
by
the
OTFs
may
be
important
in
widening
the
range
over
which
gene
expression
can
be
modulated
and
in
establishing
cell
type
specificity
.

Identification
of
a
novel
lymphoid
specific
octamer
binding
protein
(
OTF-2B
)
by
proteolytic
clipping
bandshift
assay
(
PCBA
)
.

The
octamer
sequence
ATGCAAAT
is
found
in
the
promoters
of
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
heavy
and
light
chain
genes
and
in
the
heavy
chain
enhancer
and
is
a
major
determinant
of
the
cell
type
specific
expression
of
Ig
genes
in
B
cells
.

An
apparent
paradox
is
that
the
same
sequence
serves
as
an
upstream
promoter
or
enhancer
element
in
a
variety
of
housekeeping
genes
such
as
the
histone
H2B
and
U
snRNA
genes
.

The
differential
usage
of
this
regulatory
sequence
motif
is
thought
to
be
mediated
by
different
species
of
octamer
binding
proteins
.

One
species
of
100
kd
,
designated
OTF-1
,
is
present
in
all
cell
types
and
may
exert
its
activating
function
only
when
it
can
interact
with
additional
adjacent
transcription
factors
.

The
lymphoid
cell
specific
octamer
binding
protein
of
60
kd
(
OTF-2A
)
specifically
stimulates
Ig
promoters
which
consist
essentially
of
a
TATA-box
and
an
octamer
sequence
upstream
of
it
.

Here
we
present
evidence
for
yet
another
B
cell
specific
octamer
binding
protein
of
75
kd
(
OTF-2B
)
.

From
several
findings
,
including
the
absence
of
OTF-2B
(
but
not
OTF-2A
)
from
a
lymphocyte
line
that
can
not
respond
to
the
IgH
enhancer
,
we
propose
a
role
of
the
novel
octamer
factor
in
the
long
range
activation
by
the
IgH
enhancer
.

We
have
used
the
proteolytic
clipping
bandshift
assay
(
PCBA
)
technique
to
distinguish
the
three
different
forms
found
in
B
cells
.

This
analysis
indicates
that
the
75
kd-species
OTF-2B
is
closely
related
to
the
60
kd
species
OTF-2A
.

Inhibition
of
interleukin
2
-induced
proliferation
of
cloned
murine
T
cells
by
glucocorticoids
.

Possible
involvement
of
an
inhibitory
protein
.

The
ability
of
glucocorticoids
to
inhibit
interleukin
2
(
IL
2
)
-induced
T
cell
proliferation
in
two
cytotoxic
T
cell
(
CTL
)
clones
has
been
studied
.

A
complete
inhibition
of
DNA
synthesis
by
dexamethasone
(
Dx
)
could
be
observed
when
IL
2-depleted
cultures
of
CTL
were
either
incubated
for
6
h
with
the
hormone
prior
to
the
addition
of
IL
2
or
treated
simultaneously
with
Dx
and
a
low
concentration
of
IL
2
.

No
significant
reduction
in
the
number
and
affinity
of
IL
2
receptors
was
seen
after
6
h
incubation
with
Dx
.

The
order
of
potency
observed
with
the
different
steroids
indicated
that
this
inhibitory
effect
was
mediated
through
binding
to
a
specific
glucocorticoid
receptor
.

The
action
of
these
hormones
possibly
involves
the
synthesis
of
an
inhibitory
protein
(
s
)
,
since
the
presence
of
cycloheximide
during
the
incubation
with
Dx
prevented
the
inhibition
of
DNA
synthesis
.

Furthermore
,
supernatant
from
Dx-treated
CTL
contained
a
nondialyzable
factor
which
inhibited
DNA
synthesis
and
cell
growth
of
CTL
clones
induced
by
IL
2
.

Blocking
of
IL
2
synthesis
and
IL
2
receptor
formation
have
been
proposed
as
one
of
the
major
mechanisms
of
glucocorticoid-induced
immunosuppression
.

Our
results
indicate
that
these
hormones
may
also
affect
T
cell
proliferation
by
inhibiting
IL
2
activity
.

Identification
and
purification
of
a
human
immunoglobulin-enhancer-binding
protein
(
NF-kappa
B
)
that
activates
transcription
from
a
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
promoter
in
vitro
.

The
enhancer-binding
factor
NF-kappa
B
,
which
is
found
only
in
cells
that
transcribe
immunoglobulin
light
chain
genes
,
has
been
purified
from
nuclear
extracts
of
Namalwa
cells
(
human
Burkitt
lymphoma
cells
)
by
sequence-specific
DNA
affinity
chromatography
.

The
purified
NF-kappa
B
has
been
identified
as
a
51-kDa
polypeptide
by
UV-crosslinking
analysis
.

``
Footprint
''
and
methylation-interference
analyses
have
shown
that
purified
NF-kappa
B
has
a
binding
activity
specific
for
the
kappa
light
chain
enhancer
sequence
.

The
purified
factor
activated
in

transcription
of
the
human

type
I
promoter
by
binding
to
an
upstream

Lymphocyte
glucocorticoid
receptor
binding
in
depression
:
normal
values
following
recovery
.

The
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
in
lymphocytes
and
plasma
cortisol
concentrations
were
measured
in
20
patients
who
had
recovered
from
major
depressive
disorder
and
20
healthy
control
subjects
.

The
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
in
lymphocytes
from
the
recovered
depressed
group
was
not
significantly
different
from
that
of
the
control
group
.

Although
the
mean
plasma
cortisol
concentration
in
recovered
depressives
was
higher
than
in
control
subjects
,
the
difference
only
just
reached
significance
.

This
study
shows
that
the
reduction
in
glucocorticoid
receptor
numbers
which
occurs
during
acute
depressive
illness
does
not
persist
on
recovery
and
is
,
therefore
,
state-dependent
.

Identification
and
purification
of
a
human
lymphoid-specific
octamer-binding
protein
(
OTF-2
)
that
activates
transcription
of
an
immunoglobulin
promoter
in
vitro
.

The
octamer
sequence
5'-ATGCAAAT
,
in
either
orientation
,
serves
as
an
upstream
element
in
a
variety
of
promoters
and
also
occurs
as
a
modular
enhancer
element
.

It
is
of
particular
interest
in
immunoglobulin
genes
since
it
is
found
in
the
upstream
regions
of
all
heavy
and
light
chain
promoters
and
in
the
heavy
chain
enhancer
,
both
of
which
are
known
to
be
necessary
for
cell-specific
expression
.

We
report
here
the
chromatographic
separation
of
ubiquitous
and
B
cell-specific
octamer-binding
proteins
.

The
B
cell
factor
was
purified
to
homogeneity
using
affinity
chromatography
and
consists
of
three
peptides
of
62
,
61
,
and
58.5
+/-
1.5
kd
.

Each
of
the
polypeptides
was
renatured
after
SDS-PAGE
and
shown
to
bind
to
the
octamer
sequence
.

The
specific
DNA
binding
activity
of
the
pure
B
cell-specific
factor
was
indistinguishable
from
that
of
the
affinity-purified
ubiquitous
factor
.

This
B
cell-specific
octamer-binding
factor
,
in
pure
form
,
activated
transcription
from
a
kappa
light
chain
promoter
in
vitro
,
thus
demonstrating
that
it
is
indeed
a
B
cell-specific
transcription
factor
for
this
gene
.

In
addition
to
the
ubiquitous
and
B
cell-specific
octamer-binding
factors
,
we
identified
several
additional
proteins
,
one
of
which
is
B
cell
-specific
,
that
interact
with
the
kappa
promoter
.

Decreased
deoxyribonucleic
acid
binding
of
glucocorticoid-receptor
complex
in
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
a
patient
with
the
glucocorticoid
resistance
syndrome
.

A
patient
with
the
syndrome
of
glucocorticoid
resistance
was
studied
.

A
27-yr-old
woman
initially
was
diagnosed
as
having
Cushing
's
disease
,
based
on
the
findings
of
high
plasma
ACTH
and
serum
cortisol
levels
,
increased
urinary
cortisol
secretion
,
resistance
to
adrenal
suppression
with
dexamethasone
,
and
bilateral
adrenal
hyperplasia
by
computed
tomography
and
scintigraphy
of
the
adrenal
glands
.

However
,
she
had
no
signs
or
symptoms
of
Cushing
's
syndrome
.

During
a
5-yr
follow-up
,
no
clinical
abnormalities
developed
,
although
hypercortisolism
persisted
.

End-organ
resistance
to
cortisol
was
suspected
.

To
explain
the
end-organ
resistance
to
cortisol
,
the
glucocorticoid
receptors
(
GR
)
in
peripheral
mononuclear
leukocytes
and
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
a
forearm
skin
biopsy
were
characterized
and
compared
with
the
results
of
similar
studies
in
normal
subjects
.

The
patient
's
GR
in
whole
cell
assays
had
an
increased
dissociation
constant
(
Kd
)
.

In
the
cytosol
of
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
the
patient
,
there
was
also
decreased
binding
capacity
.

The
thermal
stability
and
the
sedimentation
coefficient
in
a
sucrose
density
gradient
of
the
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
the
patient
and
normal
subjects
were
similar
.

GR
complex
activation
,
analyzed
by
DEAE-cellulose
chromatography
,
was
decreased
in
the
patient
.

DNA
binding
of
the
GR
complex
after
temperature-induced
activation
was
lower
in
the
patient
than
in
normal
subjects
.

Nuclear
translocation
of
GR
complexes
from
the
patient
was
also
slightly
decreased
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
patient
's
glucocorticoid
resistance
was
due
to
a
decrease
in
the
affinity
of
the
receptor
for
glucocorticoids
and
a
decrease
in
the
binding
of
the
GR
complex
to
DNA
.

Granulocyte-macrophage

.

Sensitive
and
receptor-mediated
regulation
by
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3
in
normal
human
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
.

We
show
that
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3
(
1
,
25
[
OH
]
2D3
)
,
the
most
hormonally
active
metabolite
of
vitamin
D3
,
modulates
sensitively
and
specifically
both
the
protein
and
messenger
RNA
accumulation
of
the
multilineage
growth
factor
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
(
GM-CSF
)
.

The
regulation
of
GM-CSF
expression
is
seen
in
both
normal
human
mitogen-activated
T
lymphocytes
and
T
lymphocytes
from
a
line
(
S-LB1
)
transformed
with
human
T
cell
lymphotropic
virus
1
(
HTLV-1
)
.

In
contrast
,
cells
from
a
HTLV-1
transformed
T
lymphocyte
line
(
Ab-VDR
)
established
from
a
patient
with
vitamin
D-resistant
rickets
type
II
with
undetectable
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
cellular
receptors
are
resistant
to
the
action
of
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
.

Inhibition
of
GM-CSF
expression
by
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
can
occur
independently
of
interleukin
2
regulation
and
is
probably
mediated
through
cellular
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
receptors
.

We
conclude
that
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
may
be
important
in
the
physiology
of
hematopoiesis
.

Altered
interaction
between
triiodothyronine
and
its
nuclear
receptors
in
absence
of
cortisol
:
a
proposed
mechanism
for
increased
thyrotropin
secretion
in
corticosteroid
deficiency
states
.

Thyroid
hormones
occasionally
appear
less
effective
when
administered
alone
to
patients
with
panhypopituitarism
,
and
manifestations
suggestive
of
hypothyroidism
have
been
reported
in
patients
suffering
from
untreated
Addison
's
disease
.

In
the
latter
condition
,
thyrotropin
secretion
is
increased
:
this
occurs
already
after
as
little
as
2
days
of
temporary
withdrawal
of
therapy
with
substitution
doses
of
corticosteroids
while
circulating
levels
of
thyroid
hormones
remain
within
normal
limits
.

Therefore
,
a
possible
role
of
cortisol
in
interaction
between
triiodothyronine
and
its
nuclear
receptors
was
examined
at
the
level
of
circulating
lymphocytes
obtained
from
patients
with
primary
or
secondary
adrenocortical
failure
.

The
affinity
of
these
receptors
was
found
to
be
decreased
,
by
more
than
50
%
on
average
,
in
the
absence
of
cortisol
treatments
.

This
change
was
promptly
corrected
upon
resumption
of
therapy
.

The
number
of
binding
sites
was
not
significantly
modified
.

The
influence
of
cortisol
on
thyroid
hormone
receptors
discussed
here
might
account
for
the
clinical
observations
mentioned
above
.

Inhibition
by
cortisol
of
human
natural
killer
(
NK
)
cell
activity
.

The
effects
of
cortisol
on
the
natural
killer
(
NK
)
activity
of
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
(
PBM
)
cells
were
studied
in
vitro
using
a
direct
4-h
51Cr-release
assay
and
K
562
cell
line
as
a
target
.

Preincubation
for
20
h
of
PBM
cells
drawn
from
healthy
donors
with
1
X
10
(
-8
)
to
1
X
10
(
-5
)
M
cortisol
resulted
in
a
significant
decrease
of
NK
cell
activity
.

The
magnitude
of
the
suppression
was
directly
related
to
the
steroid
concentration
and
inversely
related
to
the
number
of
effector
cells
.

Cortisol
was
able
to
minimize
the
enhancement
of
NK
cytotoxicity
obtainable
in
the
presence
of
immune
interferon
(
IFN-gamma
)
.

A
significantly
higher
suppression
was
achieved
after
sequential
exposure
of
PBM
cells
to
cortisol
and
equimolar
levels
of
prostaglandin
E2
(
PgE2
)
.

The
concomitant
incubation
with
theophylline
and
isobutyl-methylxanthine
failed
to
enhance
the
cortisol-induced
suppression
,
whereas
PgE2-dependent
inhibition
significantly
increased
after
exposure
of
PBM
cells
to
methyl-xanthines
.

The
inhibitory
effect
of
cortisol
was
partially
or
totally
prevented
by
the
concomitant
incubation
with
equimolar
amounts
of
11-deoxycortisol
and
RU
486
but
not
of
progesterone
.

Treatment
of
NK
effectors
with
a
monoclonal
anti-human
corticosteroid-binding
globulin
(
CBG
)
antibody
produced
an
enhancement
of
the
spontaneous
NK
activity
and
a
partial
suppression
of
cortisol-mediated
effects
.

Our
results
suggest
that
endogenous
glucocorticoids
play
a
role
in
the
regulation
of
NK
cell-mediated
cytotoxicity
.

Since
the
effect
of
cortisol
was
additive
to
that
of
PgE2
and
was
not
changed
by
phosphodiesterase
inhibitors
,
it
is
conceivable
that
the
hormone
acts
at
a
level
different
from
the
adenylate
cyclase
-
phosphodiesterase
system
.

Data
obtained
with
the
use
of
antiglucocorticoids
and
the
anti-CBG
antibody
are
compatible
with
a
role
both
of
high-affinity
glucocorticoid
receptors
and
of
CBG
in
mediating
cortisol
action
on
the
human
NK
cell
activity
.

Interaction
of
cell-type-specific
nuclear
proteins
with
immunoglobulin
VH
promoter
region
sequences
.

All
human
and
murine
immunoglobulin
heavy
chain
variable
region
(
VH
)
genes
contain
the
sequence
ATGCAAAT
approximately
70
nucleotides
5
'
from
the
site
of
transcription
initiation
.

This
octanucleotide
,
in
reverse
orientation
,
is
also
found
in
all
light
chain
variable
region
(
VL
)
genes
,
and
in
the
immunoglobulin
heavy
chain
transcriptional
enhancer
.

Transfection
studies
have
established
that
this
octamer
is
involved
in
the
lymphoid-specific
transcription
of
immunoglobulin
genes
.

Octamer-containing
fragments
have
been
reported
to
bind
a
factor
present
in
nuclear
extracts
of
human
cell
lines
;
however
,
identical
binding
activity
was
detected
in
both
B
lymphoid
and
non-lymphoid
cells
.

Here
we
establish
that
nuclear
extracts
from
distinct
cell
types
differ
in
their
ability
to
interact
with
octamer-containing
fragments
.

We
have
also
detected
a
DNA-protein
interaction
that
may
be
involved
in
the
cell-type
specificity
of
immunoglobulin
expression
,
and
we
have
determined
that
a
sequence
upstream
of
the
octamer
participates
in
an
interaction
with
a
nuclear
protein
(
s
)
.

Preferential
transcription
of
HTLV-I
LTR
in
cell-free
extracts
of
human
T
cells
producing
HTLV-I
viral
proteins
.

The
promoters
of
the
adenovirus
2
major
late
gene
,
the
mouse
beta-globin
gene
,
the
mouse
immunoglobulin
VH
gene
and
the
LTR
of
the
human
T-lymphotropic
retrovirus
type
I
were
tested
for
their
transcription
activities
in
cell-free
extracts
of
four
cell
lines
;
HeLa
,
CESS
(
Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed
human
B
cell
line
)
,
MT-1
(
HTLV-I-infected
human
T
cell
line
without
viral
protein
synthesis
)
,
and
MT-2
(
HTLV-I-infected
human
T
cell
line
producing
viral
proteins
)
.

LTR
was
preferentially
transcribed
in
the
extracts
of
MT-2
although
the
other
three
genes
were
transcribed
with
relatively
constant
efficiencies
in
different
extracts
.

The
results
agree
well
with
the
previous
in
vivo
studies
on
the
promoter
activity
of
HTLV-I
LTR
.

Mixing
of
HeLa
and
MT-2
extracts
revealed
the
presence
of
a
LTR-specific
stimulating
activity
in
MT-2
extracts
.

A
nuclear
factor
that
binds
to
a
conserved
sequence
motif
in
transcriptional
control
elements
of
immunoglobulin
genes
.

Trans-acting
factors
that
mediate
B-cell
specific
transcription
of
immunoglobulin
genes
have
been
postulated
based
on
an
analysis
of
the
expression
of
exogenously
introduced
immunoglobulin
gene
recombinants
in
lymphoid
and
non-lymphoid
cells
.

Two
B-cell-specific
,
cis-acting
transcriptional
regulatory
elements
have
been
identified
.

One
element
is
located
in
the
intron
between
the
variable
(
V
)
and
constant
(
C
)
regions
of
both
heavy
and
kappa
light-chain
genes
and
acts
as
a
transcriptional
enhancer
.

The
second
element
is
found
upstream
of
both
heavy
and
kappa
light-chain
gene
promoters
.

This
element
directs
lymphoid-specific
transcription
even
in
the
presence
of
viral
enhancers
.

We
have
sought
nuclear
factors
that
might
bind
specifically
to
these
two
regulatory
elements
by
application
of
a
modified
gel
electrophoresis
DNA
binding
assay
.

We
report
here
the
identification
of
a
human
B-cell
nuclear
factor
(
IgNF-A
)
that
binds
to
DNA
sequences
in
the
upstream
regions
of
both
the
mouse
heavy
and
kappa
light-chain
gene
promoters
and
also
to
the
mouse
heavy-chain
gene
enhancer
.

This
sequence-specific
binding
is
probably
mediated
by
a
highly
conserved
sequence
motif
,
ATTTGCAT
,
present
in
all
three
transcriptional
elements
.

Interestingly
,
a
factor
showing
similar
binding
specificity
to
IgNF-A
is
also
present
in
human
HeLa
cells
.

The
new
world
primates
as
animal
models
of
glucocorticoid
resistance
.

Many
New
World
primate
species
have
greatly
increased
plasma
cortisol
concentrations
,
decreased
plasma
cortisol
binding
globulin
capacity
and
affinity
,
marked
resistance
of
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis
to
suppression
by
dexamethasone
,
and
no
biological
evidence
of
glucocorticoid
excess
.

These
primates
also
have
high
levels
of
circulating
progesterone
,
estrogen
,
mineralocorticoid
,
androgen
and
vitamin
D
.

The
glucocorticoid
target
tissues
that
have
been
examined
(
circulating
mononuclear
lymphocytes
and
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
)
have
normal
concentrations
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
with
decreased
affinity
for
dexamethasone
.

Transformation
of
B-lymphocytes
with
the
Epstein-Barr
virus
leads
to
glucocorticoid
receptor
induction
that
is
less
than
that
observed
with
cells
from
Old
World
primates
.

The
receptor
in
these
cells
has
a
low
affinity
for
dexamethasone
.

The
low
affinity
leads
to
an
increased
loss
of
specific
bound
ligand
during
thermal
activation
.

Meroreceptor
generation
is
normal
.

The
molecular
weight
of
the
receptor
,
determined
by
SDS-PAGE
,
is
similar
to
that
of
Old
World
primates
(
approximately
92
,
000
)
and
the
activation
pattern
per
se
,
examined
in
vitro
by
heating
cytosol
and
performing
phosphocellulose
chromatography
,
appears
similar
to
that
of
human
controls
.

The
ratios
of
nuclear
to
cytosolic
hormone-receptor-complexes
and
of
cytosolic
activated
to
unactivated
receptor
complexes
in
intact
cells
are
similar
to
Old
World
primates
.

Results
from
mixing
studies
do
not
support
the
hypothesis
that
a
binding
inhibitor
(
s
)
or
a
deficient
cytosolic
positive
modifier
(
s
)
of
binding
underlies
the
findings
in
these
primates
.

The
New
World
primates
,
unlike
men
with
the
syndrome
of
primary
cortisol
resistance
,
have
compensated
for
their
condition
with
intra-adrenal
and
mineralocorticoid
receptor
adaptations
.

Thus
,
unlike
Old
World
primates
,
cortisol
in
New
World
primates
has
only
weak
sodium-retaining
potency
because
the
aldosterone
receptor
has
a
low
affinity
for
cortisol
.

The
common
element
that
would
explain
the
apparent
resistance
to
six
steroid
hormones
in
New

Acetylation
and
modulation
of
erythroid
Kruppel-like
factor
(
EKLF
)
activity
by
interaction
with
histone
acetyltransferases
.

Erythroid
Kruppel-like
factor
(
EKLF
)
is
a
red
cell-specific
transcriptional
activator
that
is
crucial
for
consolidating
the
switch
to
high
levels
of
adult
beta-globin
expression
during
erythroid
ontogeny
.

EKLF
is
required
for
integrity
of
the
chromatin
structure
at
the
beta-like
globin
locus
,
and
it
interacts
with
a
positive-acting
factor
in
vivo
.

We
find
that
EKLF
is
an
acetylated
transcription
factor
,
and
that
it
interacts
in
vivo
with
CBP
,
p300
,
and
P/CAF
.

However
,
its
interactions
with
these
histone
acetyltransferases
are
not
equivalent
,
as
CBP
and
p300
,
but
not
P/CAF
,
utilize
EKLF
as
a
substrate
for
in
vitro
acetylation
within
its
trans-activation
region
.

The
functional
effects
of
these
interactions
are
that
CBP
and
p300
,
but
not
P/CAF
,
enhance
EKLF
's
transcriptional
activation
of
the
beta-globin
promoter
in
erythroid
cells
.

These
results
establish
EKLF
as
a
tissue-specific
transcription
factor
that
undergoes
post-translational
acetylation
and
suggest
a
mechanism
by
which
EKLF
is
able
to
alter
chromatin
structure
and
induce
beta-globin
expression
within
the
beta-like
globin
cluster
.

Recognition
of
herpes
simplex
virus
type
2
tegument
proteins
by
CD4
T
cells
infiltrating
human
genital
herpes
lesions
.

The
local
cellular
immune
response
to
herpes
simplex
virus
(
HSV
)
is
important
in
the
control
of
recurrent
HSV
infection
.

The
antiviral
functions
of
infiltrating
CD4-bearing
T
cells
may
include
cytotoxicity
,
inhibition
of
viral
growth
,
lymphokine
secretion
,
and
support
of
humoral
and
CD8
responses
.

The
antigens
recognized
by
many
HSV-specific
CD4
T
cells
localizing
to
genital
HSV-2
lesions
are
unknown
.

T
cells
recognizing
antigens
encoded
within
map
units
0.67
to
0.73
of
HSV
DNA
are
frequently
recovered
from
herpetic
lesions
.

Expression
cloning
with
this
region
of
DNA
now
shows
that
tegument
protein
VP22
and
the
viral
dUTPase
,
encoded
by
genes
UL49
and
UL50
,
respectively
,
are
T-cell
antigens
.

Separate
epitopes
in
VP22
were
defined
for
T-cell
clones
from
each
of
three
patients
.

Reactivity
with
the
tegument
protein
encoded
by
UL21
was
identified
for
an
additional
patient
.

Three
new
epitopes
were
identified
in
VP16
,
a
tegument
protein
associated
with
VP22
.

Some
tegument-specific
CD4
T-cell
clones
exhibited
cytotoxic
activity
against
HSV-infected
cells
.

These
results
suggest
that
herpes
simplex
tegument
proteins
are
processed
for
antigen
presentation
in
vivo
and
are
possible
candidate
compounds
for
herpes
simplex
vaccines
.

Fibrinogen
activates
NF-kappa
B
transcription
factors
in
mononuclear
phagocytes
.

Adhesion
to
extracellular
matrices
is
known
to
modulate
leukocyte
activation
,
although
the
mechanisms
are
not
fully
understood
.

Mononuclear
phagocytes
are
exposed
to
fibrinous
provisional
matrix
throughout
migration
into
inflammatory
foci
,
so
this
study
was
undertaken
to
determine
whether
fibrinogen
triggers
activation
of
NF-kappa
B
transcription
factors
.

U937
cells
differentiated
with
PMA
in
nonadherent
culture
were
shown
to
express
two
fibrinogen-binding
integrins
,
predominately
CD11b/CD18
,
and
to
a
lesser
extent
,
CD11c/CD18
.

Cells
stimulated
with
fibrinogen
(
10-100
microg/ml
)
/Mn2+
(
50
microM
)
for
2
h
were
examined
by
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
.

NF-kappa
B
activation
,
minimal
in
unstimulated
cells
,
was
substantially
up-regulated
by
fibrinogen
.

Fibrinogen
also
caused
activation
of
AP-1
,
but
not
SP1
or
cAMP
response
element-binding
protein
(
CREB
)
factors
.

Blocking
mAbs
against
CD18
and
CD11b
abrogated
fibrinogen
-induced
NF-kappa
B
activation
.

To
determine
the
effects
on
transcriptional
regulation
,
U937
cells
were
transfected
with
a
plasmid
containing
the
HIV-1
enhancer
(
bearing
two
NF-kappa
B
sites
)
coupled
to
a
chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase
(
CAT
)
reporter
.

Cells
were
subsequently
stimulated
with
1
)
PMA
for
24
h
,
inducing
CAT
activity
by
2.6-fold

h
,
inducing

)
costimulation
with
fibrinogen
and
PMA
,
inducing
5.7-fold
the
CAT
activity
induced
by
PMA
alone
.

We
conclude
that
contact
with
fibrinogen-derived
proteins
may
contribute
to
mononuclear
phagocyte
activation
by
signaling
through
CD11b/CD18
,
resulting
in
selective
activation
of
transcriptional
regulatory
factors
,
including
NF-kappa
B
.

Peripheral
blood
T
cells
and
monocytes
and
B
cell
lines
derived
from
patients
with
lupus
express
estrogen
receptor
transcripts
similar
to
those
of
normal
cells
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
identify
and
characterize
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
transcripts
expressed
in
immune
cells
of
patients
with
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
(
SLE
)
and
healthy
donors
.

METHODS
:
Peripheral
blood
monocytes
and
T
cells
were
prepared
from
patients
with
SLE
(
n
=
6
)
and
healthy
donors
(
n
=
8
)
.

T
cells
were
separated
into
CD4
and
CD8
.

Some
monocytes
and
T
cells
were
stimulated
with
estradiol
,
PMA
,
and
ionomycin
.

Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed
B
cell
lines
(
n
=
7
)
and
B
cell
hybridomas
(
n
=
2
)
established
from
patients
with
SLE
and
a
healthy
individual
were
used
as
a
B
cell
source
.

These
cells
were
examined
for
ER
mRNA
by
reverse
transcription
nested
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

Amplified
cDNA
were
sequenced
by
standard
methods
.

RESULTS
:
In
all
cells
tested
,
ER
mRNA
was
expressed
without
prior
in
vitro
stimulation
.

Partial
sequences
from
exons
1-8
were
nearly
identical
to
the
published
sequence
of
the
human
ER
mRNA
.

There
were
no
notable
differences
in
the
ER
transcripts
between
patients
and
healthy
controls
.

Variant
receptor
transcripts
lacking
exon
5
or
exon
7
,
which
encodes
the
hormone
binding
domain
,
were
identified
in
the
majority
of
the
cells
.

Precise
deletion
of
the
exons
suggests
that
they
are
alternatively
spliced
transcripts
.

Whether
the
detected
transcripts
are
translated
into
functional
receptor
proteins
remains
to
be
determined
.

In
vitro
stimulation
did
not
affect
ER
mRNA
expression
.

The
presence
of
variants
did
not
correlate
with
disease
activity
or
medication
.

CONCLUSION
:
Monocytes
,
T
cells
,
and
B
cells
in
patients
express
transcripts
of
the
normal
wild
type
ER
and
the
hormone
binding
domain
variants
in
vivo
.

DNA
damaging
agents
induce
expression
of
Fas
ligand
and
subsequent
apoptosis
in
T
lymphocytes
via
the
activation
of
NF-kappa
B
and
AP-1
.

Apoptosis
induced
by
DNA
damage
and
other
stresses
can
proceed
via
expression
of
Fas
ligand
(
FasL
)
and
ligation
of
its
receptor
,
Fas
(
CD95
)
.

We
report
that
activation
of
the
two
transcription
factors
NF-kappa
B
and
AP-1
is
crucially
involved
in
FasL
expression
induced
by
etoposide
,
teniposide
,
and
UV
irradiation
.

A
nondegradable
mutant
of
I
kappa
B
blocked
both
FasL
expression
and
apoptosis
induced
by
DNA
damage
but
not
Fas
ligation
.

These
stimuli
also
induced
the
stress-activated
kinase
pathway
(
SAPK/JNK
)
,
which
was
required
for
the
maximal
induction
of
apoptosis
.

A
1.2
kb
FasL
promoter
responded
to
DNA
damage
,
as
well
as
coexpression
with
p65
Rel
or
Fos/Jun
.

Mutations
in
the
relevant
NF-kappa
B
and
AP-1
binding
sites
eliminated
these
responses
.

Thus
,
activation
of
NF-kappa

A
nonpeptidyl
small
molecule
SB
247464
,
capable
of
activating
granulocyte-colony-stimulating
factor
(
G-CSF
)
signal
transduction
pathways
,
was
identified
in
a
high-throughput
assay
in
cultured
cells
.

Like
G-CSF
,
SB
247464
induced
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
multiple
signaling
proteins
and
stimulated
primary
murine
bone
marrow
cells
to
form
granulocytic
colonies
in
vitro
.

It
also
elevated
peripheral
blood
neutrophil
counts
in
mice
.

The
extracellular
domain
of
the
murine
G-CSF
receptor
was
required
for
the
activity
of
SB
247464
,
suggesting
that
the
compound
acts
by
oligomerizing
receptor
chains
.

The
results
indicate
that
a
small
molecule
can
activate
a
receptor
that
normally
binds
a
relatively
large
protein
ligand
.

Minimal

with
PML/RAR
alpha
or
AML1/ETO
mRNA
and
phenotypic
analysis
of
possible
T
and

in

.

Here
we
studied
minimal
residual
disease
(
MRD
)
of
patients
with
acute
myeloid
leukemia
(
AML
)
who
have
PML/RAR
alpha
or
AML1/ETO
as
well
as
the
phenotypic
analysis
of
lymphocyte
subsets
involved
in
antitumor
immunity
.

Eight
patients
in
long-term
(
LT
;
3
to
15
years
)
and
15
patients
in
short-term
(
ST
;
up
to
3
years
)
remission
were
studied
.

Using
the
reverse
transcription-polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT
)
assay
,
the
limit
of
detection
was
10
(
-5
)
to
10
(
-6
)
for
PML/RAR
alpha
transcript
and
10
(
-4
)
to
10
(
-5
)
for
the
AML1/ETO
transcript
.

Simultaneously
,
T
lymphocyte
subsets
and
NK
cells
from
the
peripheral
blood
(
PB
)
and
bone
marrow
(
BM
)
were
investigated
by
flow
cytometric
analysis
.

Four
of
the
eight
patients
in
LT
and
7
of
the
15
patients
in
ST
remission
were
MRD-positive
.

Although
all
MRD-positive
patients
in
LT
remission
are
still
until
now
event-free
,
3
of
the
7
MRD-positive
(
MRD+
)
patients
in
ST
remission
soon
relapsed
.

The
total
populations
of
CD4
+
,
CD8
+
and
CD56
+
[
possible
T-cell
and
natural
killer
(
T/NK
)
populations
]
in
the
BM
of
ST
patients
and
MRD+/LT
patients
were
significantly
(
p
<
.01
)
low
.

The
CD8+
CD28+
population
showed
the
same
tendency
(
p
<
.01-.02
)
.

The
T/NK
subsets
in
the
BM
of
MRD-negative
(
MRD-
)
LT
(
MRD-/LT
)
patients
showed
similar
numbers
of
cells
as
normal
volunteers
.

Basically
,
the
total
percentage
of
the
CD4+
,
CD8+
and
CD56+
cell
populations
in
the
BM
was
increased
and
in
the
following
order
:
MRD-/LT
patients
,
normal
volunteers
,
MRD+/LT
patients
and
MRD+
or
-/ST
patients
.

The
percentages
of
the
T/NK-cell
subsets
in
the
PB
were
not
significantly
different
among
these
groups
.

Thus
,
the
difference
of
the
possible
T/NK-cell
phenotype
in
the
BM
may
strongly
influence
clinical
and
molecular
remission
.

These
results
still
remain
to
be
confirmed
by
further
studies
of
the
functional
anti-tumor
immunity
of
T/NK
cells
of
AML
in
remission
.

Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
mannose-capped
lipoarabinomannan
can
induce
NF-kappaB
-dependent
activation
of
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
long
terminal
repeat
in
T
cells
.

Tuberculosis
has
emerged
as
an
epidemic
,
extended
by
the
large
number
of
individuals
infected
with
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
(
HIV-1
)
.

The
major
goal
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
the
mycobacterial
cell
wall
component
mannose-capped
lipoarabinomannan
(
ManLAM
)
of
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
(
M.
tuberculosis
)
could
activate
transcription
of
HIV-1
in
T
cells
with
the
use
of
an
in
vitro
cell
culture
system
.

These
experiments
are
of
prime
importance
considering
that
CD4
-expressing
T
lymphocytes
represent
the
major
virus
reservoir
in
the
peripheral
blood
of
infected
individuals
.

Using
the
1G5
cell
line
harbouring
the
luciferase
reporter
gene
under
the
control
of
the
HIV-1
LTR
,
it
was
first
found
that
culture
protein
filtrates
(
CFP
)
from
M.
tuberculosis
or
purified
ManLAM
could
activate
HIV-1
LTR-dependent
gene
expression
unlike
similarly
prepared
CFP
extracts
devoid
of
ManLAM
.

The
implication
of
protein
tyrosine
kinase
(
s
)
,
protein
kinase
A
and/or
protein
kinase
C
was
highlighted
by
the
abrogation
of
the
ManLAM-mediated
activation
of
HIV-1
LTR-driven
gene
expression
using
herbimycin
A
and
H7
.

It
was
also
determined
,
using
electrophoresis
mobility
shift
assays
,
that
M.
tuberculosis
ManLAM
led
to
the
nuclear
translocation
of
the
transcription
factor
NF-kappaB
.

M.
tuberculosis
ManLAM
resulted
in
clear
induction
of
the
luciferase
gene
placed
under
the
control
of
the
wild-type
,
but
not
the
kappaB-mutated
,
HIV-1
LTR
region
.

Finally
,
the
ManLAM-mediated
activation
of
HIV-1
LTR
transcription
was
found
to
be
independent
of
the
autocrine
or
paracrine
action
of
endogenous
TNF-alpha
.

The
results
suggest
that
M.
tuberculosis
can
upregulate
HIV-1
expression
in
T
cells
and
could
thus
have
the
potential
to
influence
the
pathogenesis
of
HIV-1
infection
.

Human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
long
terminal
repeat
quasispecies
differ
in
basal
transcription
and
nuclear
factor
recruitment
in
human
glial
cells
and
lymphocytes
.

The
generation
of
genomic
diversity
during
the
course
of
infection
has
the
potential
to
affect
all
aspects
of
HIV-1
replication
,
including
expression
of
the
proviral
genome
.

To
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
impact
of
long
terminal
repeat
(
LTR
)
sequence
diversity
on
LTR-directed
gene
expression
in
cells
of
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
and
immune
system
,
we
amplified
and
cloned
LTRs
from
proviral
DNA
in
HIV-1-infected
peripheral
blood
.

Sequence
analysis
of
nineteen
LTRs
cloned
from
2
adult
and
3
pediatric
patients
revealed
an
average
of
33
nucleotide
changes
(
with
respect
to
the
sequence
of
the
LAI
LTR
)
within
the
455-bp
U3
region
.

Transient
expression
analyses
in
cells
of
neuroglial
and
lymphocytic
origin
demonstrated
that
some
of
these
LTRs
had
activities
which
varied
significantly
from
the
LAI
LTR
in
U-373
MG
cells
(
an
astrocytoma
cell
line
)
as
well
as
in
Jurkat
cells
(
a
CD4-positive
lymphocyte
cell
line
)
.

While
LTRs
which
demonstrated
the
highest
activities
in
U-373
MG
cells
also
yielded
high
activities
in
Jurkat
cells
,
the
LTRs
were
generally
more
active
in
Jurkat
cells
when
compared
to
the
LAI
LTR
.

Differences
in
LTR
sequence
also
resulted
in
differences
in
transcription
factor
recruitment
to
cis-acting
sites
within
the
U3
region
of
the
LTR
,
as
demonstrated
by
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
.

In
particular
,
naturally
occurring
sequence
variation
impacted
transcription
factor
binding
to
an
activating
transcription
factor
/
cAMP
response
element
binding
(
ATF
/
CREB
)
binding
site
(
located
between
the
LEF-1
and
distal
NF-kappaB
transcription
factor
binding
sites
)
that
we
identified
in
previous
studies
of
the
HIV-1
LTR
.

These
findings
suggest
that
LTR
sequence
changes
can
significantly
affect
basal
LTR
function
and
transcription
factor
recruitment
,
which
may
,
in
turn
,
alter
the
course
of
viral
replication
in
cells
of
CNS
and
immune
system
origin
.

HMG
box
containing
transcription
factors
in
lymphocyte
differentiation
.

The
identification
of
the
mammalian
sex-determining
gene
Sry
has
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
large
family
of
related
(
'
HMG
box
'
)
transcription
factors
that
control
developmental
events
in
yeast
,
C.
elegans
,
Drosophila
and
vertebrates
.

In
lymphocyte
differentiation
,
several
HMG
box
proteins
play
a
decisive
role
.

Sox-4
is
important
for
very
early
B-cell
differentiation
,
while
TCF-1
/
LEF-1
play
a
crucial
role
in
early
thymocyte
development
.

TCF/LEF
proteins
have
recently
been
found
to
constitute
a
downstream
component
of
the
Wingless/Wnt
signal
transduction
pathway
.

In
flies
,
this
pathway
controls
segment
polarity
;
in
Xenopus
it
controls
the
definition
of
the
body
axis
.

Deregulation
of
the
pathway
occurs
in
several
human
tumors
.

These
insights
in
the
molecular
events
that
are
involved
in
TCF/LEF
function
in
these
organisms
may
eventually
lead
to
the
understanding
of
the
function
of
these
HMG
box
proteins
in
lymphoid
development

Transcriptional
regulation
by
C/EBP
alpha
and
-beta
in
the
expression
of
the
gene
for
the
MRP14
myeloid
calcium
binding
protein
.

Transcriptional
regulation
of
the
gene
for
the
myeloid
calcium
binding
protein
,
MRP14
,
was
investigated
in
human
monocytic
leukemia
cell
lines
.

The
MRP14
gene
was
not
expressed
in
monoblastic
ML-1
cells
,
promonocytic
U-937
cells
,
or
promyelocytic
HL-60
cells
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
gene
was
expressed
in
monocytic
THP-1
cells
and
in
the
HL-60
cells
treated
with
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3
(
VD3
)
.

The
level
of
MRP14
in
VD3-treated
HL-60
cells
was
two-fold
higher
than
that
in
THP-1
cells
.

Among
several
known
transcription
factor
binding
motifs
,
nuclear
protein
(
s
)
of
VD3-treated
HL-60
cells
and
THP-1
cells
bound
to
the
CCAAT/enhancer
binding
protein
(
C/EBP
)
-binding
motif
that
was
located
in
the
upstream
region
of
the
MRP14
gene
(
-81
)
,
as
evidenced
by
the
competitive
gel
mobility-shift
assay
.

An
antibody
for
C/EBP
alpha
super-shifted
the
nucleoprotein
complex
in
THP-1
cells
but
not
in
the
VD3-treated
HL-60
cells
,
whereas
an
antibody
for
C/EBP
beta
blocked
the
formation
of
the
complex
with
the
nuclear
factor
of
the
HL-60
cells
but
not
with
that
of
THP-1
cells
.

An
anti-C/EBP
delta
antibody
had
no
effect
on
the
complex
in
either
cell
.

Thus
,
it
was
concluded
that
C/EBP
alpha
and
-beta
were
able
to
bind
to
the
C/EBP
motif
,
and
that
C/EBP
alpha
bound
to
the
motif
in
THP-1
cells
and
C/EBP
beta
bound
to
that
in
the
VD3-treated
HL-60
cells
.

Furthermore
,
to
examine
the
transcriptional
activity
of
the
C/EBP
motif
,
we
transfected
several
constructed
luciferase
reporter
DNAs
into
HL-60
cells
and
THP-1
cells
.

The
luciferase
activity
of
the
C/EBP
motif
in
HL-60
cells
was
increased
by
VD3
treatment
.

The
C/EBP
motif
in
the
MRP14
gene
was
confirmed
to
function
as
a
regulatory
region
in
VD3-treated
HL-60
cells
and
THP-1
cells
by
the
assay
.

Since
C/EBP
beta
was
also
detected
in
VD3-untreated
HL-60
cells
by
immunoblotting
,
VD3
activated
C/EBP
beta
to
bind
to
the
motif
,
probably
through
post-translational
modification
.

Patients
with
high-risk
myelodysplastic
syndrome
can
have
polyclonal
or
clonal
haemopoiesis
in
complete
haematological
remission
.

The
clonality
of
mature
peripheral
blood-derived
myeloid
and
lymphoid
cells
and
bone
marrow
haemopoietic
progenitors
from
18
females
with
myelodysplasia
(
MDS
)
(
five
refractory
anaemia
,
RA
;
one
RA
with
ringed
sideroblasts
,
RARS
;
three
chronic
myelomonocytic
leukaemia
,
CMML
;
four
RA
with
excess
of

,
RAEB
;
five
RAEB
in
transformation
,
RAEB-t
)
was
studied
by
X-chromosome
inactivation
analysis
.

Using
the
human
androgen-receptor
(
HUMARA
)
assay
,
we
analysed
the
clonal
patterns
of
highly
purified
immature
CD34+
38-
and
committed
CD34+
38+
marrow-derived
progenitors
,
and
CD16+
14-
granulocytes
,
CD14+
monocytes
,
CD3+
T
and
CD19+
B
lymphocytes
from
peripheral
blood
.

In
high-risk
patients
(
RAEB
,
RAEB-t
)
,
clonality
analysis
was
performed
before
and
after
intensive
remission-induction
treatment
.

All
patients
,
except
one
with
RA
,
had
predominance
of
a
single
clone
in
their
granulocytes
and
monocytes
.

The
same
clonal
pattern
was
found
in
CD34+
progenitor
cells
.

In
contrast
,
CD3+
T
lymphocytes
were
polyclonal
or
oligoclonal
in
14/18
patients
.

X-chromosome
inactivation
patterns
of
CD19+
B
cells
were
highly
concordant
with
CD3+
T
cells
except
for
two
patients
(
one
RA
,
one
CMML
)
with
monoclonal
B
and
polyclonal
T
lymphocytes
,
therefore
suggesting
a
clonal
mutation
in
a
progenitor
common
to
the
myeloid
and
B-lymphoid
lineages
or
the
coexistence
of
MDS
and
a
B-cell
disorder
in
these
particular
patients
.

After
high-dose
non-myeloablative
chemotherapy
,
polyclonal
haemopoiesis
was
reinstalled
in
the
mature
myeloid
cells
and
immature
and
committed
marrow
progenitors
in
three
of
four
patients
achieving
complete
haematological
remission
.

Therefore
we
conclude
that
most
haematological
remissions
in
MDS
are
associated
with
restoration
of
polyclonal
haemopoiesis
.

Prominent
sex
steroid
metabolism
in
human
lymphocytes
.

Steroid
metabolism
was
investigated
in
cultured
human
B-lymphoblastoid
cells
(
B-LCL
)
,
and
peripheral
blood
T
and
B
cells
.

Gene
expression
was
examined
by
reverse-transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
amplification
(
RT-PCR
)
.

Appropriate
sized
transcripts
were
detected
in
both
cultured
and
fresh
peripheral
lymphocytes
for
CYP11A
,
CYP17
,
HSD11L
(
11beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
I
)
,
HSD17B1
(
17beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
type
I
)
and
SRD5A1
(
5alpha-reductase
I
)
.

B-LCL
,
but
not
T
and
B
cells
,
expressed
CYP11B
.

There
was
minimal
expression
of
HSD3B1
and
HSD3B2
(
3beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
I
and
II
)
in
B-LCL
and
T
cells
.

Transcripts
for
CYP19
and
HSD11K
were
not
detected
.

Corresponding
enzymatic
activity
was
detectable
only
for
17-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
and
5alpha-reductase
,
respectively
producing
testosterone
and
5alpha-dihydrotestosterone
.

Steroid
identities
were
confirmed
by
gas
chromatography/mass
spectrometry
(
GC/MS
)
.

One
metabolite
thought
to
be
deoxycorticosterone
was
identified
by
GC/MS
as
6alpha-hydroxypregnanolone
.

It
was
concluded
that
sex
hormone
metabolism
,
including
androgen
synthesis
,
occurs
in
lymphocytes
,
and
may
modulate
immune
response
.

Human
white
blood
cells
and
hair
follicles
are
good
sources
of
mRNA
for
the
pterin
carbinolamine
dehydratase/dimerization
cofactor
of
HNF1
for
mutation
detection
.

Pterin
carbinolamine
dehydratase/dimerization
cofactor
of
HNF1
(
PCD/DCoH
)
is
a
protein
that
has
a
dual
function
.

It
is
a
pterin
4alpha-carbinolamine
dehydratase
that
is
involved
in
the
regeneration
of
the
cofactor
tetrahydrobiopterin
during
the
phenylalanine
hydroxylase-
catalyzed
hydroxylation
of
phenylalanine
.

In
addition
,
it
is
the
dimerization
cofactor
of
HNF1
that
is
able
to
activate
the
transcriptional
activity
of
HNF1
.

Deficiencies
in
the
gene
for
this
dual
functional
protein
result
in
hyperphenylalaninemia
.

Here
we
report
for
the
first
time
that
the
PCD/DCoH
mRNA
is
present
in
human
white
blood
cells
and
hair
follicles
.

Taking
advantage
of
this
finding
,
a
sensitive
,
rapid
and
convenient
method
for
screening
mutations
occurring
in
the
coding
region
of
this
gene
has
been
described

Biochemical
characterization
of
the
NF-Y

during
B

The
transcription
factor
,
NF-Y
,
plays
a
critical
role
in
tissue-specific

II
gene
transcription
.

In
this
report
the
biochemical
properties
of
the
heterotrimeric
NF-Y
complex
have
been
characterized
during
stage-specific
B-cell
development
,
and
in
several
class
II-

B-cell
lines
,
which
represent
distinct

Interaction
between
PC4
and
NF-Y
was
mapped
to
the

These
results
suggest
that
in

NF-Y
is
associated
with
the
protein
cofactor
,
PC4
,
which
may
play

Arrest
of
B
lymphocyte
terminal
differentiation
by
CD40
signaling
:
mechanism
for
lack
of
antibody-secreting
cells
in
germinal
centers
.

Despite
extensive
research
,
the
role
of
CD40
signaling
in
B
cell
terminal
differentiation
remains
controversial
.

Here
we
show
that
CD40
engagement
arrests
B
cell
differentiation
prior
to
plasma
cell
formation
.

This
arrest
is
manifested
at
a
molecular
level
as
a
reduction
in
mRNA
levels
of
secretory
immunoglobulin
gene
products
such
as
mu
(
s
)
and
J
chain
as
well
as
the
loss
of
the
transcriptional
regulator
BLIMP-1
.

Furthermore
,
the
inhibition
of
B
cell
differentiation
by
CD40
engagement
could
not
be
overcome
by
either
mitogens
or
cytokines
,
but
could
be
reversed
by
antibodies
that
interfere
with
the
CD40
/
gp39
interaction
.

These
data
suggest
that
secretory
immunoglobulin
is
not
produced
by
B
cells
that
are
actively
engaged
by
gp39-expressing
T
cells
.

A
positively

increased
cellular

alpha-Lipoic
acid
(
LA
)
is
taken
up
by
cells
and
reduced
to
its
potent
dithiol
form
,
dihydrolipoate
(
DHLA
)
,
much
of
which
is
rapidly
effluxed
out
from
cells
.

To
improve
retention
in
cells
,
the
LA
molecule
was
modified
to
confer
a
positive
charge
at
physiological
pH
